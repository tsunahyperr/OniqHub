# OniqHub

A cozy digital hub created as a personal space to gather, experiment, and share.
OniqHub is not meant to be a single-purpose app — it’s a living collection of ideas, tools, and moments, all wrapped into one private web space.

## 🌟 Why OniqHub?

Sometimes life doesn’t fit neatly into one app or one format. OniqHub was created to be a flexible playground and a safe corner on the web — a place to keep random things, little projects, notes, or even just experiments that might one day grow into something bigger.

## 🚀 Features (current & planned)

* **Simple landing site** powered by GitHub Pages
* **Random collections** — anything from notes, references, or personal projects
* **Expandable** — designed to grow as new ideas come along

---

## 🛠️ Tech

* Static site hosted via **GitHub Pages**
* Pure **HTML/CSS/JS** for now, but open to expanding with frameworks later

---

## 📌 Vision

OniqHub is not about being polished or commercial.
It’s about having a creative sandbox — a hub to keep the small, random, and personal things that matter in daily life.
